# 🛡️ AI-Powered Early Fraud Pattern Detection

An end-to-end **fraud detection system** that simulates financial transactions, extracts behavioral features, applies **machine learning models** (Isolation Forest, Autoencoder, Logistic Regression), and visualizes results in a **Streamlit dashboard**.

🔍 Designed for **financial institutions** to detect anomalies and fraudulent patterns in real time.  
📊 Built with **Python, scikit-learn, PyTorch, Streamlit**.

## 🚀 Features
- **Synthetic Transaction Simulator** – generates realistic user transaction data with fraud injection.
- **Feature Engineering** – transforms raw transactions into features like log transaction amounts & hourly patterns.
- **Models**:
  - Isolation Forest (unsupervised anomaly detection)
  - Autoencoder (deep anomaly detection)
  - Logistic Regression (supervised blending model)
- **Streaming Simulator** – mimics real-time data flow.
- **Dashboard** – interactive fraud detection insights via Streamlit.
